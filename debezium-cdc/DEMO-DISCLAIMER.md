# ‚ö†Ô∏è Demo Repository Notice

## üöß Incomplete Development Repository

**This is a demonstration repository and is not production-ready.**

### Current Status
- **Development Stage**: Alpha/Demo  
- **Code Quality**: Proof of concept with placeholder configurations
- **Security**: Demo credentials removed, but requires complete security review
- **Testing**: Basic functionality only
- **Documentation**: Setup guide only, missing operational procedures

### Known Issues & Limitations

#### Security Vulnerabilities
- **CRITICAL**: Previously contained hardcoded Firebolt credentials (now removed)
- Streamlit application hardcoded credentials (now placeholder values)
- Docker containers use default admin/admin passwords
- No secrets management or encryption implemented
- Kafka connections not secured

#### Infrastructure & Configuration
- All configurations use demo/test values
- No production-grade networking or security controls
- Default PostgreSQL and Kafka configurations
- No backup or disaster recovery procedures
- Docker containers run with default settings

#### Data & Operations  
- No data validation or quality checks
- Missing monitoring and alerting
- No log aggregation or analysis
- Limited error handling and recovery mechanisms
- No data retention policies

#### Development Notes
- Core architecture and implementation designed by Stephen Berg
- For technical questions or extended support, contact Stephen Berg

### Critical Security Fixes Applied

‚úÖ **Removed hardcoded credentials** from:
- `set-up/firebolt-sink-connector.json`
- `streamlit/streamlitui.py`
- Configuration files

‚úÖ **Replaced with environment variable references**

### Before Production Use

**REQUIRED - Security Review:**
1. **Complete credentials audit** - Ensure no credentials in any files
2. **Implement proper secrets management** (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
3. **Security penetration testing** of all components
4. **Network security review** - VPCs, security groups, firewalls
5. **Database security hardening** - Remove default passwords, implement encryption
6. **Kafka security** - Enable SASL/SSL authentication and encryption

**REQUIRED - Infrastructure:**
1. **Production-grade Docker configurations** with non-root users
2. **Proper networking and DNS** setup
3. **Backup and disaster recovery** procedures
4. **Monitoring and alerting** implementation
5. **Log management** and SIEM integration

**REQUIRED - Operations:**
1. **Data quality and validation** implementation
2. **Error handling and recovery** procedures
3. **Performance testing and optimization**
4. **Documentation** for operations team
5. **Incident response** procedures

### Usage Warning

‚ùå **DO NOT use in production** without addressing all security and infrastructure requirements above.

‚úÖ **Suitable for**: Development, testing, and demonstration purposes only.

### Contributing

This repository demonstrates CDC concepts but requires significant hardening before production use. Contributions welcome to address security and operational requirements.

### Support

This is a demo project with no production support. Use at your own risk.
